Welcome!
Today we are getting started with Sparki and setting up the dev environment. First things first, I am developing on MacOS and therefore many of the instruction are different from Windows, and some are different from Linux. Previously, I had done this on a windows based system, but i kept it contained within WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) and as a result it was really mostly linux.
