Welcome! This site was built with the intention of documenting my progress with SPARKI, as well as to help others learn a bit more about programming in a fun and educational way. The dream is to one day create a community that is centered around the robotics, open source, and education. 

Sparki is a combination of the RVR from Sphero, and the Raspberry Pi. It is currently being developed with Python as the main language which should make it a welcome project to developers both new and experienced. My long term goals for Sparki are for autonomous navigation, control with a mobile device or xbox controller, google assistant integration, and possibly simulated emotions. All code is hosted on [Sparki's Github][sparki-git] so feel free to take a look and let me know what you think.

Let the games begin!
